## Cloudapp Cloudflare Fix

This code uses a cloudflare worker to proxy Cloudapp and add in features that were removed or lacking.

Two things:

1. Linking directly to image content: https://wes.io/d5uybeNB/content.png
2. Adding Custom CSS

## This is cool

This is really cool because it means you can customize a SaaS. There is a limitation of a SaaS, maybe you can just add those features in yourself.
